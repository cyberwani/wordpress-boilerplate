# wordpress-boilerplate

This is a boilerplate and installation script for Wordpress with the WP core as a dependency and some other stuff. 


### Assumptions
- You want to have different runtime environments for development and production.
- You want a better folder structure for your Wordpress installs.
- You want to automate those tedious setup steps


### Running the installer willâ€¦
- download and unpack the current stable Wordpress core in your language of choice
- rename the `core` and `wp-content` folders
- create an `uploads` folder outside of wp-content
- set up at least two runtime environment configurations (local and live). Those will be detected based on your host name. eg. `your_host.dev`, `stage.domain.com`
- create a random DB prefix
- create fresh secret keys for each runtime environment.
- migrate the language files from core
- install a couple of MU-Plugins


## Instructions
1. Rename `gitigore` and `htaccess` to dotfiles
2. Surf to `http://your_host.dev/_install.php`
3. Follow the instructions
4. Delete `_install.php`, `_wp-config-ENV_SAMPLE.php` and `wp-config-SAMPLE.php`
5. Double check `wp-config.php` and edit your runtime configs
6. Continue with the usual wordpress install in `http://your-host/`
